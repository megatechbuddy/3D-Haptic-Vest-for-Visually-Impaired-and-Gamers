# 3D-Haptic-Vest-for-Visually-Impaired-and-Gamers
This project's goal was to make a vest that a visually impaired or gamer could use when moving around in their environment(real or virtual).

DESCRIPTION
This vest allows the visually impaired or blind to perceive their environment in 3D through its array of 48 vibration motors. This vest could also be used for gamers that play online or console games to give them cues and other important information. This vest is intuitive to use.

How the vest works:

This project uses a matrix of 48 vibration motors that wraps around the torso. The vest sends tactile feedback to the user in such a way that they can perceive the environment in front of them in 3d. This is done by using varying levels of vibrations. Eight levels of vibration were used of the possible 4096 levels. The closer something is to the wearer (or the louder the sound in gaming), the higher the intensity of vibration in the motors that correspond to the location of the object (or sound). Each motor used a maximum of 60 milliamps. If all 48 motors were running at the maximum speed for an hour, 2.88 amps would be consumed. A depth sensor, a computer, battery pack, and a microprocessor with ICâ€™s (Integrated Circuits) are needed to run the vest. The computer, the battery pack, and the electronics are contained inside a backpack.
